## app description 

We all know the famous netflix, but this time it comes with a chat function where users can get to know new people and connect with them to talk about a movie, a series or plan to watch a movie together. 

After signing up, the users can log in to their account, navigate through thousands of movies and tv shows, add their favorites to their watchlist and remove any movie they already watched.

With the chat button, they can chat live with someone else.
